# ‚å®Ô∏è Introduction

This script(.js) is included in the HTML code above. It automatically redirects the user after a specified delay.

# ‚ùì Notes :

You can replace the redirect URL with the URL of the website you want to redirect users to.
You can adjust the delay before the redirect by changing the value in setTimeout.
You can also add a button that allows users to manually redirect to the website if they don't want to wait.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to replace the following ‚¨áÔ∏è

"https://www.your-desired-website.com" with the URL of your desired website. Also, at line 9 and 10 in the index.html file you can configure what the main text in the container says.

# ‚öì Now that you've read through, let's create your own redirection page!

It's dead simple, just fork or download the source code on the releases section, and follow the steps above to get your redirection page up and running. 

# üî® More steps & Hosting

In order, I would have to use... Github(for you to fork or download this repo), after would be Visual Studio Code(if you chose to download my repo, otherwise just edit the code in GitHub), then Vercel or Cloudflare (can be any html hosting site of your choice) to host your redirection page!

# ü™∂ SEO (search engine optimization)

Remember to keep the page light, under 1kB, having a low SEO load can help load/reload the pages faster. This can aid in getting the user to the target quicker.
