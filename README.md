# ‚å®Ô∏è JS

This script(.js) is included in the HTML code above. It automatically redirects the user after a specified delay.

# ‚ùì Additional notes :

You can replace the redirect URL with the URL of the website you want to redirect users to.
You can adjust the delay before the redirect by changing the value in setTimeout.
You can also add a button that allows users to manually redirect to the website if they don't want to wait.

# üëç You can use a simple graphic for your redirection page. Here are a few suggestions,

A circular loading icon
A progress bar
A simple animation
A logo or brand image
It's important to keep the graphic clean and minimal to avoid distracting users from the redirect. (üí° tip : use bard AI by google or chatgpt by openai if you don't know how to add the above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to replace the following ‚¨áÔ∏è

"https://www.your-desired-website.com" with the URL of your desired website. Also, at line 11 and 12 in the index.html file you can configure what the main text in the container says.
Please refer to the style.css file to change site colors.
The graphic with your chosen image or animation.
This code will provide a user-friendly redirection experience with a clean and minimalist design.

In order, I would have to use... Github(for you to fork or download this repo), after would be Visual Studio Code(if you chose to download my repo, otherwise just edit the code in GitHub), then Vercel to host your redirection page!
